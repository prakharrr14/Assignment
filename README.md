# Thai-ID-OCR-App
An application that utilizes Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to analyze thai id cards and extract relevant data. This app integrates with Google Vision API for OCR processing and then parse the response to interpret the OCR results, returning the final data in JSON format. 
Here, we have taken MongoDB database and saved the results in the database. We have also implemented CRUD api to create the ocr data, modify some data, filter them or delete certain id cards.
